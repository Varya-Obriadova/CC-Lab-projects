                <p> 
                 Domovoy, according to the beliefs of the Slavs, is a good or evil spirit in the house, 
                 who is the actual “owner” of the house. The Domovoy is believed to protect the well-being 
                 of a kin in any of its aspects. It is very protective towards the children and the animals 
                 of the house, constantly looking after them. Domovoy is believed to share the joys and the
                 sorrows of the family, and warn about future events. The Domovoy become angry and reveal their
                 demonic aspect if the family is corrupted by bad behaviour and language.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> 
                <p> 
                 Nobody knows how Domovoy looks like, and will never know since it is a spirit. However, thanks to
                 its special love to animals, we can know whether it is present in the house or not. It can posses
                 different animals. Try to find out which form Domovoy manifested in this time. When interacting 
                 with the animal, it will leave the appearance of the animal and fades away. 
                 But don't piss it off. It doesn't like to be disturbed by people.
