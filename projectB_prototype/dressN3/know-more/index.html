    <h1>Fashion in Russia in the 1870s: The Real Look</h1>
    <p>
      The novel <em>Anna Karenina</em> was serialized between 1875 and 1877. During this period, women’s fashion was transitioning 
      from the wide skirts of the mid-19th century to more form-fitting silhouettes with elaborate detailing.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Fashion Features (1873–1877)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bustle (or tournure):</strong> A padded undergarment worn to create a protruding shape at the back of the skirt.</li>
      <li><strong>Trains:</strong> Skirts often extended into long, trailing trains.</li>
      <li><strong>Rich Ornamentation:</strong> Dresses were highly decorative, featuring drapery, bows, lace, embroidery, and layers of fabric.</li>
      <li><strong>Layered Looks:</strong> Corsets, chemises, petticoats, and bustles were worn beneath outer garments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Authentic garments from the time show how intricate and structured these dresses were—true masterpieces of tailoring.
    </p>

    <h2>Film Costumes vs. Historical Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Let’s take a look at five notable film versions of <em>Anna Karenina</em> and how they represented Anna's style:</p>

    <h3>1. <em>Love</em> (1927) — Greta Garbo & John Gilbert</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fashion Context:</strong> Costumes reflected 1920s style rather than 1870s authenticity.</li>
      <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The film had two different endings—one happy (for American audiences), one tragic (for Europe).</li>
      <li><strong>Costume Designer:</strong> Gilbert Clark.</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> The chemistry between Garbo and Gilbert gave the film added appeal, even if the costumes were anachronistic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. <em>Anna Karenina</em> (1935) — Greta Garbo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Costume Designer:</strong> Adrian (Adrian Adolph Greenburg), known for his glamorous and stylized Hollywood creations.</li>
      <li><strong>Style:</strong> Loosely inspired by 1870s fashion but heavily dramatized with ruffles and lace.</li>
      <li><strong>Critique:</strong> Some felt that the costumes prioritized Hollywood drama over historical accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. <em>Anna Karenina</em> (1948) — Vivien Leigh</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Costume Designer:</strong> Cecil Beaton, also known for <em>My Fair Lady</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Despite post-war fabric rationing in Britain, Beaton’s designs appeared lush and luxurious.</li>
      <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> Beaton’s photographs of Leigh in costume were featured in British Vogue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. <em>Anna Karenina</em> (1997) — Sophie Marceau</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Production:</strong> A co-production by Mel Gibson’s Icon Productions.</li>
      <li><strong>Costume Designer:</strong> Maurizio Millenotti, who trained at the legendary Tirelli tailoring workshops in Rome.</li>
      <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> This version is praised for being the most historically faithful, with costumes and accessories true to the 1870s.</li>
      <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Anna’s costumes use a black-and-white theme—black dominating during her downfall, and white during happier times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. <em>Anna Karenina</em> (2012) — Keira Knightley</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Costume Designer:</strong> Jacqueline Durran.</li>
      <li><strong>Controversy:</strong> Despite receiving an Oscar nomination, many critics argued the costumes were theatrical and did not match the period.</li>
      <li><strong>Fashion Fusion:</strong> Chanel accessories were used, giving the film a modern couture feel rather than strict period adherence.</li>
    </ul>
