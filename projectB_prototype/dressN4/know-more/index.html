    <h1>1938 – Gabrielle Chanel, Red Velvet Suit</h1>

    <!-- Descriptive text -->
    <p>
      This 1938 red silk velvet suit by Gabrielle Chanel marked a bold departure from her typically minimalist aesthetic.
      Designed for fashion icon Diana Vreeland, the suit features a cinched waist, below-the-knee skirt, gold buttons,
      and white ruffled collar and cuffs—combining elegance with historical flair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Velvet was a key fabric in the winter collections of 1938, embraced by designers like Schiaparelli and Balenciaga.
      Chanel, usually known for wool jersey and practical suits, joined the trend with this striking piece inspired by a
      masquerade ball and her interest in historical references.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Chanel herself wore a subtler black version, the vivid red suit reflected Vreeland’s flamboyant taste.
      The design’s silhouette—nipped waist and flared hips—anticipated Dior’s “New Look” nearly a decade later.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of Chanel’s last collections before World War II paused her fashion career. She would not return to
      design until 1954. Today, the red velvet suit remains a unique and theatrical chapter in Chanel’s legacy,
      blending her refined tailoring with the dramatic spirit of the late 1930s.
