    <h1>Marie Antoinette's Wedding Dress 1770s</h1>

    <p>
      When 14-year-old Marie Antoinette married the future Louis XVI in 1770, her wedding dress was designed to dazzle. 
      Crafted from silver cloth and adorned with countless diamonds, it embodied the extravagant fashion of the French court—then the center of European style. 
      Though the original gown no longer survives, contemporary engravings and similar dresses from the era offer a glimpse into its opulence.

      One such comparison is the wedding dress of Hedwig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, made just four years later. 
      Also ordered from Paris and woven with silver tissue, Hedwig’s gown reflects the luxurious style likely worn by Marie Antoinette.

      Several films have attempted to recreate Marie Antoinette’s iconic gown. 
      Milena Canonero’s version in <em>Marie Antoinette</em> (2006) opted for a modern, less ornate interpretation. 
      The 2006 French docudrama <em>Marie Antoinette: La véritable histoire</em> featured a simpler gown used across scenes for practicality. 
      In contrast, Gilbert Adrian’s legendary 1938 design for <em>Marie Antoinette</em> starring Norma Shearer stunned with sheer extravagance—made of 500 yards of satin and weighing over 100 pounds, 
      it is still considered one of the most lavish costumes in cinema history.
